<b>Jack 1</b> - input (reading PWM signal)<br>
<b>Jack 2</b> - output (gives signal with required frequency)<br>
<br>
<b>Var. Resistor 1,2</b> - used for adjust output frequency. If you require to control frequency from input PWM set this frequency to 0.
<b>Var. Resistor 3</b> - control signal length
